                            <p><strong>2019 — present</strong></p>
                            <p>Left Winterfell to ride South. Tried to kill Cersei, but Dany did it better than me ;) Then I left South and now I'm riding nowhere.</p>
                            <p><strong>2019</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Participated in the battle of Winterfell. I fought well with my new weapon made by Gendry, stayed alive after being in the library full of dead. And then suddenly, I saved Bran's and other people's lives by killing the Night King.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>2017</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Finally, after some arguments, Sansa and I revealed the devious plan of Petyr Baelish, so I killed him.</li>
                              <li>Came back to Winterfell and reunited with Bran and Sansa.</li>
                              <li>Went to the Twins. Avenged the death of my family at the Red Wedding by killing Walder Frey and all the male members of his family. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenpower">#womenpower</a> </li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Got my sight back. Then I got some misunderstanding with my boss, Jaqen (I didn't kill some woman), so I decided to quit the job.</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>I moved to Braavos to accept Jaqen's jobs offer. It was one of the most challenging and exhausting internships in my life, I even became blind! It took a long time to become 'no one' instead of Arya. But now I have really useful experience.</li>
                      </ul>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>2014</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Met Polliver, killed him and took my needle back. Then I met Brienne and she wounded Clegane, so I had to take his money and leave.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>2013</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Gendry, Sandor Clegane and I were taken to the Brotherhood Without Banners headquarters in the Riverlands. Then I escaped from the Brotherhood and was captured by Sandor Clegane who decided to take me to my mother and brother, Robb, at the Twins where my uncle is to be married. Soon I found out that they died there.</li>

                      <p><strong>2012</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Got a job offer from Jaqen to train with the Faceless Man. I declined the offer but accepted a coin from Jaqen and memorised the words ‘Valar Morghulis’ which I should use if I changed my mind.</li>
                        <li>I managed to escape from Harrenhal with Jaqen’s help. I named him as the third person to be killed saying that I would take it back if he helped me escape. Now you can see my critical thinking and problem-solving skills ;)</li>
                        <li>Saved the three murderers from death when their cart caught fire. Then became cup bearer for Tywin Lannister. One of the prisoners I released from the cart, Jaqen H’ghar, told me that because I saved three lives I can choose three people to be killed. I immediately chose the Tickler, who tortured us in captivity.</li>
                        <li>My sword, needle, was stolen by one of Armory Lorch’s men, Polliver.</li>
                        <li>Began to make a mental list of those I wanted to take revenge on. In my opinion, it is always important to set specific goals, it is such a good skill for managing your time correctly.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>2011</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Together with Hot Pie, Lommy Greenhands and Gendry, I left King’s Landing to travel north to the Wall.</li>
                        <li>My father, Ned, was imprisoned for treason by Cersei. When the guards came to take me, I was with Syrio who told me to run away. I retrieved my sword then ran on to the streets killing a stableboy who tried to stop me. It was my first kill. Then I witnessed the execution of my father.</li>
                        <li>Started practising sword fighting with Mycah, the butcher's son. Then Syrio Forel taught me how to use it properly.</li>
                        <li>Sansa, my father and I went to Kings Landing. Jon Snow gave me a sword and I named it Needle. It was the start of my career as a fighter.</li>
